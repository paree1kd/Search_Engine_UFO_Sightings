## Purpose of the Exercise
* With standard and ES6-release Javascript, find the pros and cons in utilizing JavaScript for a search engine.
* Discover the syntax of Javascript and ideal use cases.
* Using built-in Javascriptfunctions and others to build a produt.
* Turn JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Using forEach, the JavaScript version of a for loop.
* Finally, the purpose of filtering a table with JavaScript and HTML.


## Cons
The search engine is extremely senstive to what is searched. The specific date, city, and shape must be used in full to find a result. Spaces cannot be included. There can not be any variation of a name to find a result, the full datapoint must be searched including spaces.


## Suggestions
 1. First suggestion would be to add a trim function that would eliminate spaces and also allow upper and lower cases for search results to work. 
2. Second suggestion would be to allow a filter that included a range of dates instead of one day. One could not search by year or month alone.
